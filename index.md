Community groups bring a huge level of energy and resources to big picture problems like climate change, energy generation, and social resilience. Yet for all this impact they are rarely represented in media and research portrayals of solutions to social problems. This project aims to literally put community back on the map and help to put community-level solutions on the agenda more broadly.

In addition to our special focus on low-carbon [community groups](2017/01/18/groups.html) in this project we are also working to map [places of worship](churches.html).

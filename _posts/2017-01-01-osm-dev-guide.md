## Ground rules for OSM

are 
I have some thoughts as to how we can make data-sets sustainable, but the key concern here is that data entry and modification is as easy as possible, ideally from a web browser. One way to achieve this would be by concentrating our efforts on the data-set already present in the OpenStreetMaps project. One way to accomplish this would be to leverage the TransforMaps project (<a class="external-link" href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_TransforMap" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_TransforMap</a> - with thanks to Philip Revell for this tip!) which is just a front-end for OSM and doesn't have a separate database. I'm actively investigating this possibility. I am also in conversation with Ordnance Survey about helping to improve their very poor quality data (in the form of the PointX database) with our work.

[^171161631]: There is a growing body of research into OSM. For two examples, see Pascal Neis and Alexander Zipf, “Analyzing the contributor activity of a volunteered geographic information project: The case of OpenStreetMap,” ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information 2 (2012): 146–165 and Mordechai Haklay, “How good is volunteered geographical information? A comparative study of OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey datasets,” Environment and planning B: Planning and design 4 (2010): 682--703.

[^171161633]: Examples about, but take the now (in)famous example of Google's termination of the highly popular google reader project and recent commercialisation of their "maps engine" product, and more particular to mapping, Mapquest recently terminated their nominatim provision.

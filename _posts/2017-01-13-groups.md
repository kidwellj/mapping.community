Welcome community groups! We want Mapping Community to be a resource for your group. Here's what we can do for you:

### 1. Provide you with a range of different style web maps that you can embed on your group web page. 

Sample map, all members of Scottish Communities Climate Action Network:

Sample map, chronological membership list for Development Trust Association Scotland by joining date:

<iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://kidwellj.carto.com/viz/93cc9004-dc19-11e6-a6b9-0e233c30368f/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

You can update your map in real-time as your members change, as well as update and chance your maps (labels, styling, etc.) using our cartoDB portal.

### 2. Help to make sure your membership is better represented on public maps and in scholarly research.

### 3. Help your members find other local groups

### 4. Provide you with location intelligence

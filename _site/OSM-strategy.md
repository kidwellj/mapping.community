### Why OpenStreetMaps?

One of our key pathways for making this data visible and sustainable relies on deploying it onto OSM. Many of our underlying datasets on the cartoDB platform are actually just augmented replicants of OSM data.

I have some thoughts as to how we can make data-sets sustainable, but the key concern here is that data entry and modification is as easy as possible, ideally from a web browser. One way to achieve this would be by concentrating our efforts on the data-set already present in the OpenStreetMaps project. One way to accomplish this would be to leverage the TransforMaps project (<a class="external-link" href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_TransforMap" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_TransforMap</a>Â - with thanks to Philip Revell for this tip!) which is just a front-end for OSM and doesn't have a separate database. I'm actively investigating this possibility. I am also in conversation with Ordnance Survey about helping to improve their very poor quality data (in the form of the PointX database) with our work.
